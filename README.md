## Proposal
The homescreen is the page(s) that lists applications and notifications of smartphones and computers. They initially look the same as they display the default apps and wallpapers, but their appearances can and will change as users customize their homescreens through apps, the arrangement of those apps, wallpapers and themes, and more. Because users personalize them, the homescreens are able to present the users’ personality, creativity, and identity—it becomes part of the user. I believe smart devices are an extension of the self, and homescreens are reflections of the self that show personality and individuality.

My BFA show will be an installation of homescreens, displayed in different ways. Ideally, I would reserve a room with at least one large wall across the entrance. This one large wall will be filled, from corner to corner with a projector, the entirety of the collected homescreens in a grid style layout. On the side walls I will hang several frames (3 to 6 per wall, depending on sizes), in which I will either project or display on a digital screen (iPad, iPhone, small monitor, etc.) individual homescreens that changes to another after a certain amount of time. A couple of the frames, however, will not be of individual homescreens, but rather works of art created with the homescreens. One will be of all of the homescreens layered on top of each other, showing that despite all are different they are still the same or have the same basic qualities. Another will switch through different individual homescreens very rapidly, only allowing for viewers to see them for brief moments.

For this installation overall, I want to show that each homescreen tells its own story and that each is of work of art by itself, hence the framing of the individual displays. At the entrance/exit of the room will be a station that displays, along with my statement and other documents, a booth where visitors can contribute to the collective work by uploading their homescreens.
Some may find my installation of the homescreens as not being original or creative since I am simply presenting (some of) them untouched and unedited, akin to Duchamp’s Fountain. However, like Duchamp, I believe the art is in the homescreens themselves as every user crafts their own homescreen and chooses to personalize them.
