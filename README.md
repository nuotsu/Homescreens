## Statement
The 'homescreen' is the main page of smart devices that nests applications and widgets. Its appearance changes as a user customizes his/her arrangements of apps and applies themes and wallpapers. Because they are customizable, the homescreens reflect the users’ creativity, personality, and individuality. I believe smart devices are an extension of the self, and the homescreens are reflections of the self that each reveal an identity.

## Proposal
My BFA show will be an installation of homescreens, displayed in different ways. Ideally, I would reserve a room with at least one large wall across the entrance. This one large wall will be filled, from corner to corner with a projector, the entirety of the collected homescreens in a grid style layout. On the side walls I will hang several frames (3 to 6 per wall, depending on sizes), in which I will either project or display on a digital screen (iPad, iPhone, small monitor, etc.) individual homescreens that changes to another after a certain amount of time. A couple of the frames, however, will not be of individual homescreens, but rather works of art created with the homescreens. One will be of all of the homescreens layered on top of each other, showing that despite all are different they are still the same or have the same basic qualities. Another will switch through different individual homescreens very rapidly, only allowing for viewers to see them for brief moments.

For this installation overall, I want to show that each homescreen tells its own story and that each is of work of art by itself, hence the framing of the individual displays. At the entrance/exit of the room will be a station that displays, along with my statement and other documents, a booth where visitors can contribute to the collective work by uploading their homescreens.
Some may find my installation of the homescreens as not being original or creative since I am simply presenting (some of) them untouched and unedited, akin to Duchamp’s _Fountain_. However, like Duchamp, I believe the art is in the homescreens themselves as every user crafts their own homescreen and chooses to personalize them.

This installation is partly inspired by my personal experience with _shūji_ (習字) or Japanese calligraphy. Since executing each stroke requires concentration and fluid motion, the drawn characters are said to reflect the personality and confidence of the calligrapher. During the exhibition, along with uploading a homescreen, I want to have participants also include 1 to 3 words that describe their personality or the kind of person they are. A separate projection will show individual homescreens with those attributed words next to it.

## Inspired Artists
[**Teppei Koseki**](https://vimeo.com/user5214001)

Teppei Koseki has several videos on Vimeo, but I specifically am drawn to _1981-2001._ Many of the homescreen artworks have strong resemblances. For example, where stripped glimpses of entire images are interweaving together to form the combined piece (_DIVIDE (H)_ and _DIVIDE(H)_). However, in Koseki's piece the strips move across the screen from top to bottom. I had tried to do something in this manner with my work but struggled with making the movement smooth. _ONE_ is another artwork that similar with regards to the individual images being shown for a fraction of a second until another appears.

Teppei's video incorporates sound in his video. It is no music; simply what seems to be the sound of a film roll in action. Despite being simple, the sound does not take away meaning from the piece. Rather, I feel like it strengthens it as the moving and appearing images suggest aesthetic of an old projector going through its film.

[**Jer Thorp**](http://blog.blprnt.com)

Canadian generative software and data artist, known for making data visualizations for the NY Times. Ever since I started coding and playing around with JavaScript/jQuery, I have found an interest in using data as means of creating art—basically data visualization. This installation is my first attempt at creating art with a database of information—in this case images of homescreens.

[**Yannick Jacquet**](https://www.legoman.net/)

Projection mapping artist. I had the experience of working with Yannick during CSU Summer Arts at Fresno State installing a projection mapping installation. The theme of the artwork was bioluminescence on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons that may hold life. During the two weeks at Fresno, I was able to have hands-on experience with projection mapping tools such as MadMapper and Syphoner, as well as Premiere and After Effects, and be guided by Yannick.

As for my installation, I will most likely use MadMapper to project my content (HTML pages) onto the gallery walls with the projectors. Ideally, I want to have 3 projectors connect to one computer. One HTML page will be divided into 3 sections—1 section for each wall. Syphoner will send the live HTML page in realtime to MadMapper, where it will make adjustments with alignment of the walls.

[**Marcel Duchamp**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp)

Duchamp is widely known for 'readymades' (e.g. _Fountain_), or where the artist presents objects that are already made as if they are works of art. I believe homescreens are also ready-mades. I am presenting images of homescreens that are already arranged and personalized by the user of the device. I believe the art is in that process of customizing the apps and wallpapers.
